I agree with the author that the advances made were game changing on a variety of fronts.  And I can absolutely imagine computers being able to carry on conversations and acting like humans based simply on their interactions.  They would not know why they are being nice or being mean, but they will be able to mimic the behavior by learning the same way humans do.  Let's hope humans learn how to be nice to each other before we have to teach the bots.
